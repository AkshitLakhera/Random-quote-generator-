# Random Quote Generator

The Random Quote Generator is a project that allows you to retrieve a random quote from an API and display it on your screen. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and can be easily integrated into your website or web application.

## Features

- The project retrieves a random quote from the [Quotes API] and displays it on the screen.
- The quote is displayed along with the author's name and a button to generate a new quote.
- The project uses asynchronous JavaScript to retrieve the quote from the API and update the HTML without refreshing the page.
- The project is designed to be responsive and works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Getting Started

To use the Random Quote Generator, simply clone the repository or download the source code files. Then, open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

If you want to modify the project, you can make changes to the JavaScript code in the `script.js` file. You can also modify the CSS styles in the `style.css` file to change the appearance of the quote display.

## Dependencies

The Random Quote Generator project relies on the [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) library to make AJAX requests to the Quotes API and update the HTML. The library is included in the project files, so you don't need to install it separately.
